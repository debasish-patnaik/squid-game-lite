# Squid Game: Lite (Red Light / Green Light)

## Project Overview

This project is a solution to the [Red Light / Green Light](https://www.reacterry.com/portal/challenges/green-light--red-light) challenge on [reacterry](https://www.reacterry.com).

The challenge involves a recreation of the red light / green light game as seen on the popular Netflix series [Squid Game](https://www.netflix.com/title/81040344) by using boxes of red and green color as target.
The player must click the green box a certain number of times before the clock runs out to win the game, if they click on the red box the game will end.
